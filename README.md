# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and implementing Elman and Jordan architectures
## Overview
The goal of this project was to implement and investigate recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a focus on Elman and Jordan architectures. The implementation was carried out using Keras and Python on the Robot Execution Failures Data Set, available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Robot+Execution+Failures. The first step involved loading and preprocessing the dataset, which was followed by training and fine-tuning the Elman and Jordan architectures to achieve the highest possible accuracy rates.

In the final stage of the project, an ensemble of deep networks was implemented by combining the Elman and Jordan architectures. This approach aimed to improve the accuracy rate beyond what could be achieved by either architecture alone. The results of this investigation were reported, along with relevant charts and graphs, to help analyze the performance of the implemented models.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive overview of RNNs and their applications, along with insights into the performance of Elman and Jordan architectures on the Robot Execution Failures Data Set. The use of ensemble techniques further demonstrates the potential for improving the accuracy of these models.

This project was completed as part of the "Neural Networks" (changed to "Neural Computing and Deep Learning") course at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran, Iran, taught by Professor Reza Safabakhsh(<safa@aut.ac.ir>). I took this course during my Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering at AUT in Spring 2022.
